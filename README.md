# React Voting app

This is the exercise app for first chapter of book "[Fullstack Reack](https://www.fullstackreact.com "Fullstack React")" by [fullstack.io](https://www.fullstack.io/ "fullstack.io official site")

## Exercises done by me:

- Add down-voting capability to each Product. You can insert a down arrow with this

- Add a “sort direction” button to the top of ProductList, above all the products. It
should enable the user to toggle sorting products by ascending or descending.

## Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
